\chapter{Abstract}
Contemporary text-based programming languages require the programer to be
constantly vigilant against syntax errors. This affects both novice and
experienced programmers. One obvious way of eliminating syntax errors is
get rid of text. While there exist many visual programming environments, many
eschew powerful editing capabilities for being beginner friendly.
This project explores how a Lisp-based visual programming environment might be
used to mitigate syntax issues while remaining attractive to both novices and
professional programmers.

As part of the development process I contributed patches to two different
open-source projects, including adding \texttt{{\#}rrggbbaa} notation support
to the Popmotion library\cite{github-pr-popmotion} and updating
\say{styled-components} TypeScript typings to the a new major 5.0
version\cite{github-pr-styled-components}.
