abstract = {The efficiency of two character sets to be used on television screens was evaluated. Subjects performed various tasks (reading, error identification, line finding) with each of the two character sets. The text was presented using dot-matrix characters having either a fixed matrix size or a variable width. The variable-matrix character design resulted in significantly improved efficiency in two of the three tasks, and this character design is recommended for use on television screens.},

abstract = {Mastering syntax is one of the earliest challenges facing the novice programmer. Problem solving and algorithms are the focus of many first year programming classes, leaving students to learn syntax on their own while they practice writing code. In this paper we investigate the frequency with which students encounter syntax errors during a drill and practice activity. We find that students struggle with syntax to a greater extent than we anticipated, even when writing short fragments of code. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

@article{Campbell1981,
abstract = {Three computer text-processing techniques were compared. The first was typescript without right justification. The other two involved right-justified text. The first (and the most common) right-justification technique involved calculating the space from the right margin to the end of a line of text in blank-character units and distributing the space in whole-character units between the words on that line. The second right- justification technique distributed the extra space at the end of a line proportionally both between and within the words forming the line. Each subject read the same passage prepared with one of the techniques and answered a short questionnaire concerning the material in the passage. Measurements of reading time showed that the variable-spacing right-justification technique improved reading speed in relation both to the text with an unjustified right margin and to the text with the right-justified margin produced by blank insertion. {\textcopyright} 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
