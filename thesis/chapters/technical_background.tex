\subsection{Visual Programming Environments}

Mention other existing visual programming environments.

\subsection{Command Composition}
Composing user commands is an important concern for any code editor. Chodarev
\cite{Chodarev2016} discussed this in length, pointing out that casual
text-based editing environments rely on simple commands that operate only on
elementary objects, manipulating single character at a time. However this
approach is quite inefficient, leading leading apps to adopt a secondary set of
ad-hoc commands for performing specific combinations of operations and
high-level objects (like deleting a word). One proposed alternative are
Vim-like shortcuts, where the user combines a smaller set of motion and action
commands to work on high-level objects.

\subsection{Proportional fonts}
Studies like Campbell et al. \cite{Campbell1981} and Beldie et al.
\cite{Beldie1983} have shown that proportional (variable-pitch) fonts are
faster to read than their \texttt{monospaced} counterparts. One notable exaple
of a proportional font being used typeset code is

\subsection{TypeScript}
TypeScript is a structurally and gradually typed superset of JavaScript being
developed at Microsoft \cite{Typescript}. It provides stronger type-safety
guarantees than JavaScript and allows programs to use modern and experimental
JavaScript features, such as class properties or optional chaining. 


\subsection{React and related libraries}
To ease the burden of manually manipulating the \ac{dom}, Kale uses the React
\cite{React} JavaScript library. React is a self-proclaimed \say{JavaScript
library for making user interfaces} being developed by Facebook. It
allows the program to write rendering
code in a functional fashion, relying a \say{Virtual \ac{dom} to make \ac{dom}
updates efficient}. Together with \ac{jsx}, a JavaScript extension supported by
TypeScript, it makes it easy to write complex \acp{ui} for the browser.

\subsection{\acf{svg}}
\ac{svg} is a web technology which can be used to display vector images in the
browser. It is scriptable by JavaScript and styleable with CSS, making it the
perfect fit for dynamically rendering any highly custom \acp{ui}. It is used by
Scratch for rendering their blocks interface.
