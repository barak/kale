\section{Motivation}
Syntax errors are a fact of life in the programming industry. Programmers from
novice\cite{Denny2011} to professional spend significant time fighting or
avoiding syntax errors. It is clear a visual programming environment such
%TODO: Cite scratch, cite syntax errors among professionals
Scratch could eliminate syntax errors. There exists a large body of existing
visual programming environments \cite{Beldie1983}, but most focus exclusively
on making programming accessible to children and young adults. Most
professional tools focus instead of error-detection, ignoring visual means of
editing programs as slow and cumbersome. It should be possible to create a
visual programming environment friendly to novices, but powerful enough to be
taken seriously by professionals. 

This project implements a web based visual programming environment, designed
from the ground up to fit many skill levels. Kale should demonstrate that a
drag and drop/blocks style interface can co-exist alongside a keyboard driven
professional-focused editing experience. It should generate usable code,
runnable from within the interface.

\section{Project}

As part of the development process I contributed patches to two different
open-source projects, including adding \texttt{\#rrggbbaa} notation support
to the Popmotion library \cite{github-pr-popmotion} and updating
\say{styled-components} TypeScript typings to the a new major 5.0
version\cite{github-pr-styled-components}.
