\chapter*{Abstract}
Contemporary text-based programming languages require the programmer to be
constantly vigilant against syntax errors. This affects both novice and
experienced programmers. One obvious way of eliminating syntax errors is to
get rid of text. While there exist many visual programming environments, they generally
eschew powerful editing capabilities in order to be friendly to beginners.
This project explores how a Lisp-based visual programming environment might be
used to mitigate syntax issues while remaining attractive to both novices and
professional programmers.
