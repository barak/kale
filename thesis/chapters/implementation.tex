A key component of the layout engine is the notion of \say{inline} expressions.
An inline expression is one which can be easily displayed inside another inline
expression. In \autoref{fig:layout} inline expression are those with a
\textcolor{blue}{blue} outline, those with a \textcolor{red}{red} outline are
non-inline.

\hyperref[expr:literal]{Literals}, \hyperref[expr:blank]{blanks} and
\hyperref[expr:variable]{variables} are always inline, while
\hyperref[expr:list]{lists} are always non-inline.
For \hyperref[expr:function]{function calls} a heuristic-driven algorithm is
used to determine the inline status. The |isCallInline| algorithm, determines
a function call to be inline if:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item No comment exists on the function call.
	\item Every argument is also inline.
	\item The sum total length of the argument widths is below 300 pixels.
	\item The hight of the expression tree of every argument is below four.
\end{enumerate}

Non-inline function calls are broken up, and their underline stack (explained
\hyperref[layout:underlines]{below}) is rendered onto the screen, while inline
calls continue to build up the underline stack.

\subsection{Data structure}

Keeping track of all the data required by the layout algorithm
including enabling in-line editing and supporting drag and drop requires a
complex layout data structure.
Because parent expressions like function calls need access to their children's
layout information to make layout decisions, it is not sufficient to simply
treat Kale expressions as React components to be rendered. Instead the
\texttt{Layout} class is responsible for keeping track of state required
of each expression and \ac{svg} element by their parents.

\begin{Verbatim}[samepage]
export class Layout {
    size: Size;
    nodes: ReactNode[] = [];
    underlines: Underline[] = [];
    areas: Area[] = [];
    inline = false;
    isUnderlined = false;
    expr: Expr | null = null;
    partOfExpr: Expr | null = null;
    text: Optional<TextProperties>;
}
\end{Verbatim}

\newcommand{\field}[1]{
	\paragraph{\texttt{#1}}
	\label{layout:#1}
}
\field{size} A key component of effectively laying out expressions is
keeping track of their size. Note that since \ac{svg} elements have no
inherent size, this is simply a suggestion of what the predicated size
of a layout element will be.

\field{nodes} The nodes array is responsible for aggregating all the
\ac{svg} nodes rendered to up to this point.

\field{underlines} Kale's inverted stack of underlines means individual
expressions cannot know at what level and at what depth their underline will
be rendered. Instead the underlines to be drawn at the first non-inline
function calls are lazily kept track of. With each parent expression laid
out, the level and the offset relative to the parent expression is updated.
Once underlines are finally drawn.

\begin{Verbatim}[samepage]
export interface Underline {
    level: number;
    offset: number;
    length: number;
}
\end{Verbatim}

\field{areas}

\field{inline}

\field{isUnderlined} Not every inline layout element needs to create
a new underline. Kale
chooses to not underline atomic expressions like spaces, literals and variable
names.

\field{expr}

\field{partOfExpr}

\field{text}

\subsection{Text metrics}

Creating the \texttt{Layout} data structure for text elements requires
information on the metrics of piece of rendered text. Unfortunately the current
state of web text-metrics API leaves a lot to be desired. While
the |<canvas>| element provides a seemingly comprehensive
\fnurl{TextMetrics}
{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextMetrics} API.
In reality the vast majority of the metrics a system like Kale might
be interested in consuming are currently only available in latest
browsers behind experimental flags.


Instead Kale takes the same approach as the Scratch Blocks \cite{ScratchBlocks}
library, using \ac{svg}'s |getComputedTextLength| API and an invisible
|<svg>| element onto which new pieces of text are rendered.
